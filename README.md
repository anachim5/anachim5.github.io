**This is the projects I completed at my classes in the university. It was created in Java and build tasks are run by Gradle. It is an simulation of ship moving between fictional islands in order to trade goods for gold. The main goal of this was to use as many OOP principles as possible and provide clear documentation from the beginning to the end of this project**
